# tubing
When two or more cylindrical pipes intersect, a saddle-shaped curve is formed. To join the pipes (in a "saddle" or "fishmouth" joint), we need to first trim them ("coping") along that curve. This tool computes the curve, and unrolls it into a template. You can then print that template, and wrap it around the pipes to mark them for cutting.
